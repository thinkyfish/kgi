About:
 * This release is based on FreeBSD-9.CURRENT.
 * Currently i386 is the only supported platform.
 * KGI makes use of FreeBSD's VGA VESA system for mode setting and the graphics
   console. No other drivers are included.

Prerequisites:
 * Knowledge of using svn(or cvs/csup) to checkout a FreeBSD source tree.
 * Kernel configuration.
 * Building and installing FreeBSD custom kernels.
 * VESA must be >= 2.0 see "vidcontrol -i mode"
   Make sure to load vesa.ko before executing the above. 
 
Installation:
 * Copy your KGI checkout over a working copy of your FreeBSD src tree.
 * You can use the included KGI kernel config for building a KGI kernel.
   The included KGI kernel config disables & enables some FreeBSD devices &
   options. Read sys/i386/conf/KGI for more information.
 * Recommend using INSTKERNNAME=kernel.KGI or similar when installing kernel.
