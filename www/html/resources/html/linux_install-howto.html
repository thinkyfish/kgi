Installing KGI.
<ol>
	<li> Download a KGI snapshot or checkout CVS. In the Download section you can find information how to get your copy from CVS. In the near future, we'll provide snapshots too.

	<li> Download the Linux kernel sources and copy the tar.gz or tar.bz2 file into the directory kgi-0.9/kgi/Linux. We recommend 2.4.19, newer kernels should also work. The 2.5 branch is developing too fast for us to keep the patches updated. Code for the 2.5 kernels is available, though you might not succeed with the latest 2.5 kernel. Pre-2.4-kernels are not supported anymore. KGI will detect the zipped file, there is no need to unpack it.

<li> Enter the directory kgi-0.9 and run "./configure". This tool will detect the kernel source file, unpack the tarball and patch the code.

<li> Enter kgi-0.9/kgi/Linux/linux-2.x.y (where x.y depends on your kernel version) and configure the kernel with "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig". Support for KGI is enabled by default, all you have to do is configure your drivers and filesystems like you do with normal kernels. Build the kernel and install it. We recommend you add an entry to your boot loader and keep the normal kernels. KGI is still very experimental, so the KGI kernel is not recommended for normal use yet.

<li> Reconfigure your boot loader, reboot and load your new kernel. You should prevent your system from booting into graphical mode (Usually runlevel 5), for the XFree drivers and KGI drivers will probably interfere. You can make your kernel boot into runlevel 3 by defining <pre>append = "3"</pre> in your boot loader. 
Your kernel now boots with default console drivers for your primary display adapter.

<li> Enter kgi-0.9/drv/display

<li> Edit the .config file to match your hardware.

<li> Run "make" to build the system layer and Board driver for your hardware.

<li> <pre>insmod modules/system.o</pre>

<li> <pre>insmod modules/[VENDOR]/[MODEL].o display=1 </pre>(display=0 if you load the driver for your primary videocard)

<li> Compile GGI and GII with KGI and KII support (--enable-kii and --enable-kgi options when configuring)

<li> GGI / GII doesn't yet autodetect KGI. Before you can run any application, you should define two environment variables:<br> 
<pre>export GGI_DISPLAY="kgi"
export GII_INPUT="kii"</pre>

<li> Run GGI apps and test !
