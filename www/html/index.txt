Introduction
============

KGI (**Kernel Graphics Interface**), is a project that aims for a portable 
framework providing a means for fully accelerated, secure, stable & portable 
GPU drivers to be implemented and used across multiple different platforms
supporting KGI, with only needing a re-compile at most.

The basic driver functionality (including mode setting) is preformed in kernel
space, this allows for a powerful console system. 

KGI provides a flexible console system, which allows the user to map any input 
to any virtual console on any display. Multiple display support has been 
designed and implemented at the core of the KGI system since its initial design.

Together with `GGI <http://www.ggi-project.org>`_  
(**General Graphics Interface**) the two projects provide a full featured 
accelerated system to the console without the need for additional drivers.
KGI handles the minimum required for safe acceleration and mode switching,
while GGI operates from user space without loosing stability or security.

With the stable system of KGI & GGI users can make use of 
`XGGI <http://www.ggi-project.org/xggi/>`_ for a X11 environment. This setup
moves X11 away from kernel space and leaves the hardware management up to KGI

However, if the user chooses so, there is no need for a heavy X11 based
environment. Applications can run in a full screen graphics mode directly on
the console.
