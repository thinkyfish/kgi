Introduction
============

* KGI (**Kernel Graphics Interface**), is a project that aims for a portable 
  framework providing a means for fully accelerated, secure, stable & portable 
  GPU drivers.

* The basic driver functionality (including mode setting) is preformed in kernel
  space, this allows for a powerful console system (see next point below). 

* KGI provides a flexible console system, which allows the user to map any input 
  to any virtual console on any display. Multiple display support has been 
  designed and implemented at the core of the KGI system since its beginnings

* Together with `GGI <http://www.ggi-project.org>`_  
  (**General Graphics Interface**) the two projects provide a full featured 
  accelerated system to the console without the need for additional drivers.
  KGI handles the minimum required for safe acceleration and mode switching,
  while GGI operates from user space without loosing stability or security.

* With the stable system of KGI & GGI users can make use of 
  `XGGI <http://www.ggi-project.org/xggi/>`_ for a X11 environment. This setup
  moves X11 away from kernel space and leaves the hardware access to KGI
 
* However, if the user chooses so, there is no need for a heavy X11 based
  environment. Applications can run in full screen graphics mode directly on
  the console.
