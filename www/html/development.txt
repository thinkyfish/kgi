KGI porting guide

[You may want to view the developer mailing list archives for a start]

Plans
=====

`Follow the to do list <todo.html>`_ as far as time permits.

Site maintenance
================

 The kgi-project.org site is generated with the `ggi-project.org  
 <http://www.ggi-project.org>`_ project's web site infrastructure build/system.

 To obtain the infrastructure use CVS and checkout the 
 `www <http://kgi.cvs.sourceforge.net/kgi/www>`_ module.

 Copy the `ggisettings` file from the checkout in 
 `html/infrastructure/ggisettings` to your $HOME directory & rename it to
 `.ggisettings`
 
 You will need configure the paths correctly in `.ggisettings` to reflect
 where CVS stored the www module checkout.

 The content for the web site is stored in various `*.txt` files located in 
 `html/`
 
 `cd` to `html/infrastructure` & `make site`.
  
 Your system will need `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and `docutils 
 <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ installed to successfully complete 
 `make site`.

The `change log <changelog.html>`_ tracks the development of the web site. Please keep it updated.

Status
======

FreeBSD
-------
Currently the `freebsd <http://kgi.cvs.sourceforge.net/kgi/freebsd>`_ module 
is the only actively developed code at this time.

The i386 port is working at an alpha status. Currently KGI makes use of 
FreeBSD's VESA mode setting and graphics capablities. Booting into multi user
mode is functioning, and the systems appears to be stable.

With the recent work of OpenBSD's VESA AMD64 emulation ported to FreeBSD, it may
be possible to port the i386 code to AMD64.

No GPU drivers have been ported, re-written or updated yet.

This effort is based on the original works from nsouch's P4 repo.

Shut up and hack :-)

the Hurd
--------

The core KGI system was in the process of being ported to GNU Hurd. [It would be
neat to get some information on how this went]

Linux
-----
The Linux branch has stagnated. It was last built against a 2.4 kernel.

Other systems
-------------

Over the years there has been interest in KGI from other projects, 
`NetBSD <http://netbsd.org/>`_ & other BSD systems for example, though it is
unclear on where the progress has stalled (if any was made) at this point.
