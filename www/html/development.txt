Site maintenance
================

 The kgi-project.org site is generated with the `ggi-project.org  
 <http://www.ggi-project.org>`_ project's web site infrastructure build
 system.

 To obtain the infrastructure use CVS and checkout the 
 `www <http://kgi.cvs.sourceforge.net/kgi/www>`_ module.

 Copy the `ggisettings` file from the checkout in 
 `html/infrastructure/ggisettings` to your $HOME directory & rename it to
 `.ggisettings`
 
 You will need configure the paths correctly in `.ggisettings` to reflect
 where CVS stored the www module checkout.

 cd to `html/infrastructure` & `make site`.
 
 Your system will need `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and `docutils 
 <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ installed to successfully complete 
 `make site`.

Status
======

FreeBSD
-------
Currently the `freebsd <http://kgi.cvs.sourceforge.net/kgi/freebsd>`_ module 
is the only actively developed code at this time.

Mode setting is working. The input & graphics console system is mostly working &
is taking advantage of VESA/VGA. This means that there is only a i386 port for
the time being. 

There is still some issues with input interface interacting with FreeBSD.

No GPU drivers have been ported or re-written as yet.

This effort is based on the original works of nsouch's P4 repo.

Shut up and hack :-)

Linux
-----
The Linux branch has stagnated. It was last built against a 2.4 kernel.

Plans
=====

`Follow the to do list <todo.html>`_ as far as time permits.
