General
=======

New ideas, development strategies and user support happens via 
`IRC`_ (Internet relay chat). However, there are also `mailing lists`_ available.
They are provided to reach a broader audience in the event someone cannot be
raised on IRC.

IRC
===

Check out the **#KGI** channel on the `FreeNode Network
<http://www.freenode.net/>`_. This channel is intended to be for KGI support,
development and related topics. Chatting is allowed, but please keep things
friendly.

The channel is logged and the logs can be found at `http://woo.li/logs/kgi/ 
<http://woo.li/logs/kgi/>`_.

Currently, **#KGI** is redirected to it's sibling project **#GGI**

Mailing lists
=============

We currently have one mailing list for KGI, hosted at 
`sourceforge.net <sourceforge.net>`_ where it is intended that users & 
developers can ask questions, relate success-stories and exchange ideas and or
recipes.

`Subscribe kgi-develop <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kgi-develop>`__
(`SSL-protected <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kgi-develop>`__)

Archives of the mailing lists can be found at the subscription links 
above.

In order to avoid problems with spam on the mailing lists, we do not allow
posts from non-subscribers; if you do not wish to subscribe, send your messages
to a KGI developer (recommend using IRC). Unfortunately, spammers have started 
abusing the `From` field of emails, making people think our mailing lists are 
insecure.

Please check the 
`archives <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=kgi-develop>`_ 
for proof that our lists are safe. If such messages do not go via our lists, 
there is very little we can do about the spammers; sue them and/or filter their
garbage out.

Alternatively
=============

Alternatively you can contact the `GGI (General Graphic Interface)`__
project and ask for what you need there.
