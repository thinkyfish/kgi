General
=======

New ideas, development strategies and user support happens via `IRC`_ (Internet relay chat). However,
there are also `mailing lists`_ available they're provided to reach a broader audience.

IRC
===

Check the **#kgi** channel on the `FreeNode Network
<http://www.freenode.net/>`_. This channel is intended to be for KGI
support, development and related topics. Chatting is allowed, but
please keep things friendly.

`The channel is logged <http://woo.li/logs/kgi/>`_.

Currently, **#kgi** is redirected to **#ggi**

Mailing lists
=============

We currently have one mailing list for KGI, hosted at `sourceforge.net <sourceforge.net>`_
where it is intended that users & developers can ask questions, relate
success-stories and exchange ideas and or recipes.

`Subscribe kgi-develop <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kgi-develop>`__
(`SSL-protected <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kgi-develop>`__)

Recent archives of the mailing lists can be found at the subscription links 
above.

In order to avoid problems with spam on the mailing lists, we do not allow
posts from non-subscribers; if you do not wish to subscribe, send your messages
to a KGI developer. Unfortunately, spammers have started abusing the From
field of emails, making people think our mailing lists are insecure.
Please check the archives referred to above for proof that our lists are safe.
If such messages do not go via our lists, there is very little we can do
about them; sue them and/or filter their garbage out.

Alternatively
=============

Alternatively you can contact the `GGI (General Graphic Interface)`__
project and ask for what you need.
