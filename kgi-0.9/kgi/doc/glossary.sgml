<tag/dot/
	The smallest unit a display (CRT, LCD, TFT, ...) can control
	independently. This unit is determined by the dot clock rate
	and the total lines per frame. It should not be confused with
	the dot pitch size. It is mode dependent.

<tag/dot pitch/
	The smalles unit a display can physically resolve. This is 
	determined mainly by the CRT amplifier bandwith, LCD/TFT physical
	resolution, etc. This is a physical characteristica of the display.
